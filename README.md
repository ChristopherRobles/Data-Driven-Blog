# Data-Driven-Blog

A class project which involved using real data from the web to Write a story about our data. The report had to show illustrations with plots and also statistical analysis.

# Description-of-Project

After finding an interesting dataset online it was then uploaded to R Studio. The data was then explored by using different tools taught in class. A hypothesis was then formed and the p-value was calculated by using a z-test. 

A post was then submitted where I had introduced myself, explained where the data came from, and why I chose it. This was followed by my analysis, the hypothesis that was tested (with results), and my final thoughts on the findings and how it can be leveraged by businesses and/or ordinary people.
